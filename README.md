# Server files
Rough instructions:
- Download Smartfox Server Pro 1.6.6 (commonly shortened to SFS Pro) from its official website.
- Extract it twice to two folders called `sf-notification` and `sf-game` (make sure it doesn't have an SFS_1.6.6 folder in it, extract the contents of SFS_1.6.6 folder into these two folders) .
- Copy the contents `sf-notification` and `sf-game` files into the extracted files respectively. Replace if necessary.
- Set up a MySQL server via any method, XAMPP can help simplify on Windows.
- Create a database called `shso`.
- Use the provided `.sql` file for a sample DB with username: `User` and password: `password` (simply excute it in your MySQL server).
- Edit the `config.xml` file in both folders and provide the DB's username and password, for XAMPP defaults are username: `root` and password is blank, don't put anything for the password, leave it empty.
- Edit all `sf-game/` and `sf-notification/` paths across all scripts to point to the absolute path (like, `/home/user/sf-game/` for Linux and `D:\folder\sf-game\` for Windows.
- Start the server by running a terminal window in both folders and type `.\start.sh` (for Linux, for Windows it is `.\start.bat`, don't forget to `cd` to the folder in both cases).
- Don't forget to edit the IP in the game directory's `AssetBundles\Configuration\server.xml`.
# Contributing
Make a fork and submit a PR with your changes.
This requires understanding in ActionScript (similar to JavaScript) and Python to understand the server code, but you will also need to check the game client repo [SHSUnderground/shso-unity-project](https://github.com/SHSUnderground/shso-unity-project) to understand what responses are missing and how to format them, so both Unity and C# understanding is required.
