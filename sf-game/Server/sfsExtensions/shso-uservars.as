/*
* SmartFoxServer PRO
* Simple Extension Example
* v 1.0.0
* 
*
* Extensions Overview:
* -----------------------------------------------------------------
* Every extension must implement four basic methods:
* 
* init(), destroy(), handleRequest(), handleInternalEvent()
* 
* init()			It's the initialization point of the extension
* 				This method is invoked by the server on the extension as soon as it is loaded
* 				You can put here all your initialization code.
* 
* destroy()			This method is called by the server when the extension is going to be destroyed
* 				You should always put in this method the necessary code to release the resources
* 				you were using like setInterval(s), database connections etc...
* 
* handleRequest()		This method receives the client requests
* 
* handleInternalEvent()		Handles internal server events. Events are:
* 
* 				userJoin	when a user joins the room / zone
* 				userExit	when a user exits a room
* 				userLost	when a user disconnects
* 				newRoom		a new room was created in the zone
* 				roomLost	a room was destroyed in the zone
* 				loginRequest	a custom login request arrived	
*  
*/

		_server.sendResponse(response, fromRoom, sender, recipients, type)
		
		response	 An object containing all properties and objects that you want to send to the client(s). On the client side you will obtain the same exact object.
				As a convention there should be always a property called _cmd containing the name of the action being performed.

				If you use the raw/string protocol, you will have to pass an Array of parameters instead of an object. (Check the example below)
		fromRoom	 (optional) The roomId from where this message is coming. If you don't need it, just set it to -1
		sender	 	(optional) The User object that you want to pass as the sender of this message. If you don't need this just use null
		recipients	 an Array containing one ore more User objects
		type	 	(optional) By default it is set to "xml", and the message will be XML formatted. You can also specify "str" if you wish to send a raw, string based message.
