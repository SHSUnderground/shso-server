/*
* SmartFoxServer PRO
* Simple Extension Example
* v 1.0.0
* 
*
* Extensions Overview:
* -----------------------------------------------------------------
* Every extension must implement four basic methods:
* 
* init(), destroy(), handleRequest(), handleInternalEvent()
* 
* init()			It's the initialization point of the extension
* 				This method is invoked by the server on the extension as soon as it is loaded
* 				You can put here all your initialization code.
* 
* destroy()			This method is called by the server when the extension is going to be destroyed
* 				You should always put in this method the necessary code to release the resources
* 				you were using like setInterval(s), database connections etc...
* 
* handleRequest()		This method receives the client requests
* 
* handleInternalEvent()		Handles internal server events. Events are:
* 
* 				userJoin	when a user joins the room / zone
* 				userExit	when a user exits a room
* 				userLost	when a user disconnects
* 				newRoom		a new room was created in the zone
* 				roomLost	a room was destroyed in the zone
* 				loginRequest	a custom login request arrived	
*  
*/

* this function is called as soon as the extension
* is loaded in the server.

/*
* This method is called by the server when an extension
* is being removed / destroyed.

* Always make sure to release resources like setInterval(s)
* open files etc in this method.
